  <h2>What is this?</h2>

  <p>Divvy calculates payments between parties for complex
  expenditures, typically on an event. Participants are people who
  took part in the event and are collectively responsible for the
  event's expenses. Creditors are people, usually but not necessarily
  participants, who are owed money for expenses associated with the
  event. They may also have contributed time or goods with an
  agreed-upon value. Debtors are participants who owe money for expenses.</p>

  <p>Each expense requires a creditor, an amount, and one or more
  debtors. By default, the debtors are all participants, but you can
  include only specific participants for a specific expense. For
  example, if a subset of participants went out to dinner during the
  event and wish to split the cost as part of the final tally.</p>
